## Recover dependancies
Before launch app and api, recover dependencies npm and bower
```
yarn
```

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

And run API node in `/api` and listen `localhost:3000`.
```
node api.js
```

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
